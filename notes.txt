TODO
 clean up code, make all models work (CRITICAL)
 rotation and manipulation of models (HIGH)
 lerping to position (NORMAL)


NOTES
Right now, each marker has its own handler. this is because previously, having one marker handler meant that one marker being recognized moved all models to that location.
